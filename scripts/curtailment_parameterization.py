This script contains functions to parameterize the curtailment of wind energy and solar PV resources 
based on outputs from PyPSA-Eur at forced renewable penetration levels.

It contains the two key functions:

    1) base_curtailment: calculates the base curtailment of wind and solar, i.e., the curtailment
                         at which no renewable integration support measures are taken (e.g., storage 
                         deployment, transmission expansion, flexible demand, etc.). This representation
                         includes the dependence of wind curtailment on solar penetration and vice versa.

    2) technology_term: calculates the impact on the curtailment level by installing a technology 
                        (e.g., storage, transmission, heat pump, etc.) relative to the activity of 
                        the technology. For storage, the activity is the dispatch of the storage.
