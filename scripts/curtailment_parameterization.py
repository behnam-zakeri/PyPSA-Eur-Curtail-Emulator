This script parameterizes the curtailment of wind and solar in PyPSA-Eur. 
It consists of the following main functions:
    1) base_curtailment: calculates the base marginal curtailment
    2) technology_term: calculates the curtailment reduction per activity of the considered technology

    # ---------------------------------------------------
    # This function calculates the base marginal curtailment 
    # curves for both wind and solar which together with the additional 
    # technology contribution (calculated in a seperate function) can be 
    # used to represent the curtailment of renewables in 
    # energy models that do not contain subannual 
    # timeslicing. The calculation is based on outputs 
    # of PyPSA-Eur at forced penetration levels of wind 
    # and solar. As we transition into the 2D field, 
    # instead of the existing 1D representation, both wind 
    # and solar will have marginal components. This function
    # calculates the curtailment parameters that account for 
    # this 2D dependence.

    # the base curtailment. Note that base_0 and base_scenario are the same for SDES.

    # in the curtailment reduction term (i.e., it would be a product of wind resources (variable of the optimization) 
    # and the activity of the technology (which is also a variable of the optimization). The commented lines below
