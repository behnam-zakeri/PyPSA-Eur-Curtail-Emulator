This script contains functions to parameterize the curtailment of wind energy and solar PV resources 
based on outputs from PyPSA-Eur at forced renewable penetration levels.

It contains the two key functions:

    1) base_curtailment: calculates the base curtailment of wind and solar, i.e., the curtailment
                         at which no renewable integration support measures are taken (e.g., storage 
                         deployment, transmission expansion, flexible demand, etc.). This representation
                         includes the dependence of wind curtailment on solar penetration and vice versa.

    2) technology_term: calculates the impact on the curtailment level by installing a technology 
                        (e.g., storage, transmission, heat pump, etc.) relative to the activity of 
                        the technology. For storage, the activity is the dispatch of the storage.

    This function calculates the parameters used to represent the 
    base curtailment of wind energy and solar PV resources.
    As the curtailment of wind energy resources not only depend 
    on the wind penetration level but also on the solar penetration, 
    this function calculates the curtailment parameters that account
    for this 2D dependence.
